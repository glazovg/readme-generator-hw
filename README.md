<a name="usage"></a>
## Usage
To start generating README files type in terminal:

1. `node index.js`
2. Answer all the questions, some of them require an extensive explanation, for those questions the default editor is going to be open (vim for Unix/Linux, notepad.exe for Windows) for a better interaction.
3. Once all the questions are answered the README file is generated under results folder.

To create a new one just repeat the previous instructions again.
